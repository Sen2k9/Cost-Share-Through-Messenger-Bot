# Cost-Share-Through-Messenger-Bot
## Calculating the shared cost of a group in messenger bot 
From my personal experience, I see that close community (i.e. country-based community in LaTech, group of friends) often arrange different program i.e. get together on a community member house, potluck party, trip, organize national festival etc. After each program someone need to take charge of calculating the total and share cost of each member, which is tedious and time-consuming job. One option to get rid of this hassle is to use an app which will automatically do all the stuff. However, installing another apps, frequently check the update in the apps is also another burdensome job. On the other hand, most of the person (All!) use the Facebook and Messenger. If itâ€™s possible to make a messenger bot it will be a lot easier to reach all the member of the community (typically closed community are connected through messenger using group).
