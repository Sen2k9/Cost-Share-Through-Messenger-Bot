# Cost-Share-Through-Messenger-Bot
## Calculating the shared cost of a group in messenger bot 
It has seen that close community (i.e. country-based community in LaTech, group of friends) often arrange different program i.e. get together on a community member house, potluck party, trip, organize a national festival, etc. After each program, someone needs to take charge of collecting all the costs, calculating the shared cost, and letting each member about his or her share, which is a tedious and time-consuming job. One option to get rid of this hassle is to use an app that will automatically do all the stuff. However, installing another app, frequently check the update in the apps is also another burdensome job. On the other hand, most of the people (All!) use Facebook and Messenger. If it is possible to make a messenger bot which will do all the above-mentioned job it will be a lot easier to reach all the members of the community (typically closed community are connected through messenger using group).
